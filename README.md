# Create own blockhain #

**Using Proof-of-Work mechanism**
*(We need to put a lot of computing power into making a block - this process is also call mining)*

**Security issues without PoW:**
- Anyone can change the contents of the block
- Recalculate the hashes all for all the blocks
- It ends up with a valid chain
